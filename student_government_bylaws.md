# Olin College Student Government By-Laws
*As agreed upon by the Student Government on May 1, 2015.*

## Part I. Relative to the Student Government.

### Article 1. The Student Government.

#### Section 1. Constituency.

The Student Government serves and acts as the voice of the Student Body of the
College. The Student Body is defined as all currently enrolled students of the
College who plan to graduate from Olin College. At times when the Student
Government, its members, or its Committees must communicate to the entire
Student Body, they email the Student Government Announcements mailing list.

#### Section 2. Meetings.

Meetings of the Student Government occur monthly at a regularly scheduled time
set by the President and are open for the Student Body to attend and
participate in discussion. A meeting of the Student Government may be canceled,
postponed, or rescheduled at the President’s discretion. Additional meetings
may also be scheduled as appropriate at the President’s discretion.

The time, location, and agenda of each normally scheduled meeting of the
Student Government is announced at least 24 hours in advance in an email sent to
the Student Body and the CORe Discussion mailing list. Additional or rescheduled
meetings that do not occur during normally scheduled times should be announced
to the Student Body at least 48 hours in advance, if at all possible.

Meetings of the Student Government serve as the exclusive venue to pass Official
Actions, as described in Section 4.  Additionally, meetings of the Student
Government can serve as venues to discuss and formulate Official Actions,
discuss the state of the Student Body and Student Experience, allow Committees
to take charge of proposed projects, and other activities deemed relevant by the
presiding officer.

#### Section 3. Quorum.

In order for the proceedings of a meeting of the Student Government to be
valid, a quorum of the Student Government must be present in person or by video
conference. At least a majority of the Council together with at least a majority
of the Committee Leaders is considered a quorum of the Student Government.

#### Section 4. Official Actions.

Official Actions of the Student Government include issuing Allocation Orders,
amending the By-Laws, and reviewing amendments to the Constitution. All Official
Actions of the Student Government may be passed with approval of a majority of
the voting members present. All Official Actions are recorded with a unique
identifier.

#### Section 5. Allocation Orders.

The Student Government issues Allocation Orders to appropriate the Student
Activities Fund. Allocation Orders of the Student Government allocate funds
from the Student Activities Fund for the virtual funds. Allocation Orders may
reallocate funds from one virtual fund to another. Allocation Orders may also
restrict the use of any funds which originated from the Student Activities
Fund.

#### Section 6. The Student Government Budget.

Each year, before Transition Day, the outgoing Student Government drafts the
next year's budget, designated Allocation Order 0, informed by their experience
of a full year in office. The outgoing Student Government passes their draft to
the incoming Student Government who, within a month after Transition Day, amends
or approves Allocation Order 0 to establish a budget for their session of
Student Government. Allocation Order 0 appropriates money for the virtual funds
defined in [Article 9, Section 2](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-2-virtual-funds).

#### Section 7. A Service to the Community.

3. actively improves student life by championing or contributing to Council
   Projects, allocating their Class Fund, and organizing class events.

Each class has one class representative, except for the First Year Class,
which has two representatives, as this class would otherwise be
under-represented on the Council.

#### Section 5. Meetings.

In general, meetings of the Council occur weekly and the Student Body is highly
encouraged to participate in open sessions. Meetings of the Student Government
count as meetings of the Council. A meeting of the Council may be canceled,
postponed, or rescheduled at the President’s discretion. Additional meetings may
also be scheduled as appropriate at the President’s discretion.

The time, location, and agenda of each normally scheduled meeting of the
Council is announced at least 24 hours in advance with an email sent to the CORe
Discussion mailing list. The email sent to the Student Body announcing the
meeting of the Student Government may be used to remind students of the weekly
meetings of the Council but may not replace the weekly CORe Discussion mailing
list announcement.

Meetings of the Council serves as the exclusive venue to pass Official Actions,
as described in Section 8. Additionally, meetings of the Council can serve as
venues to discuss and formulate Official Actions, discuss topics relating to the
Administration, discuss the state of the Student Body and Student Experience,
and other activities deemed relevant by the presiding officer.

#### Section 6. Quorum.

states: Open Session or Closed Session. When the Council is in Open Session, any
member of the Olin community may be present and participate in discussion. When

subsection of the Council as defined in [Article 2, Sections 11](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-11-discretionary-fund)
[and 12](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-12-class-events-funds)

Class Representative may issue Allocation Orders to allocate and spend their
Class Fund with the consent of the Vice President for Finance. Events and
activities paid for using a Class Fund should be directed towards the graduating
class corresponding to the fund from which the money was allocated. For the
purposes of documentation, Class Fund Allocation Orders are documented in the
minutes of the next meeting of the Council and treated as an Official Action.

Class Representatives are encouraged to enlist the help of fellow classmates to
organize and plan class events.

#### Section 13. Recommendations.

As the core of the Student Government, the Council may express the official
opinion of the Student Government in the form of Recommendations. It is the
responsibility of the President to ensure Recommendations are conveyed to the
appropriate member(s) of the College’s Administration.

#### Section 14. Council Projects.

The establishment of a Council Project is a commitment by the Council to
address an issue or topic. To establish a Project, a Project Document must be
approved by the Council. A Project Document includes at least: a title, the date
established, the goal, and the timeframe over which the goal is to be achieved.
The Project Document is a working document. The President appoints a Project
Lead who is responsible for coordinating the Project and a Project Team who
assists in the execution of the Project. Project Teams can consist of any
members of the Olin community. When a Project is established, it is “Active” and
is the responsibility of the Council until the Council marks it “Complete,”
“Suspended,” or “Unsuccessful.” Any Projects remaining at the end of the school
year carry over into the next year. Council Projects may be proposed by any
member of the Olin community.

#### Section 15. Committee Appointments.

When requested by the Administration to appoint students to faculty and
operational committees, the Council begins the appointment process. In the
appointment process, the Council notifies the Student Body of openings on
committees and the position’s description, and students are allowed at
least three days to volunteer. At a meeting following the volunteering period,
the Council discusses the candidates and appoints students to the committees
by excellence voting.

#### Section 16. Appellate Authority.

If a major disagreement arises between a Director and their Assistant Director
or between a Committee and a club or organization, either party may appeal to
the Council by contacting the presiding officer in writing and requesting that
the Council arbitrate the disagreement. At the next meeting of the Council, the
presiding officer requests the presence of both parties, and the Council hears
testimony. The parties involved in the disagreement then leave the room, and the
Council deliberates. If appropriate, the Council may invite the parties involved
to return in order to suggest a solution to the disagreement. However, the
Council votes without the parties involved present and its decision is final.

#### Section 17. Monthly Reports.

Each month, the Council publishes a brief report to the Student Body outlining
the accomplishments and activities of the Student Government for that month as
well as any activities of the Administration that would be of interest to the
Student Body.

#### Section 18. Conflicts of Interest.

A member of CORe should excuse themselves from a vote if there is a clear
conflict of interest. Specifically, a member should excuse themselves if an
Allocation Order provides direct and exclusive benefit to that member or if the
vote relates to an appointment or internal election in which they are a
candidate.

#### Section 19. Ad Hoc Representatives.

The Student Government establishes the following non-voting ad hoc
representatives of the Council:

**The Senior Class Activities Representative.** Elected by the Rising Senior
Class in the spring, the Senior Class Activities Representative ensures the
completion of senior class obligations such as ordering class rings, organizing
the class gift, fundraising, serving on the Commencement Steering Committee, and
supporting the class representative in organizing class activities and Senior
Week activities.

#### Section 5. SAC Budget.

The SAC Budget is allocated jointly by the Director and Assistant Director of
Student Activities for the purpose of fulfilling the Mission and Function of the
Committee. Events and activities paid for using the SAC Budget should be open to
the entire Student Body.

#### Section 6. Funding Procedures.

Any member of the Student Body may request funding from the SAC Budget for an
activity consistent with the Function of the Committee by submitting a request
to the Director of Student Activities. So that one person cannot allocate large
amounts of money alone, both the Director and Assistant Director must approve
allocations. The Director serves as the point of contact for students who are
requesting funds from the Committee, but any request must be approved by both
Officers. The Director sends a summary of expenditures to the Vice President for
Finance once per week broken down by event.

### Article 5. The Committee for Clubs and Organizations.

#### Section 1. Function.

Pursuant to its mission, as defined in the Constitution ([Article 7, Section
1](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_constitution.md#section-1-mission-2)),
the Committee for Clubs and Organizations allocates organization budgets
annually and allocates funds to clubs upon request.

#### Section 2. Officers.

The Committee has two elected Officers, the Director and Assistant Director of
Clubs and Organizations.

**Director of Clubs and Organizations.** The Director of Clubs and Organizations
runs meetings of the Committee and generally oversees the Committee’s
activities. The Director approves the creation of Student Groups, classifies
them as Clubs or Organizations, and generally helps them meet their goals. The
Director sends or otherwise makes accessible a summary of spendings to the 
Vice President for Finance, once per week, broken down by Student Group.

of the Director, the Assistant Director performs the duties of the Director and
attends meetings of the Student Government. With the agreement of the Director,
the Assistant Director may appropriate money from the CCO Budget.

#### Section 3. General Membership.

The General Membership of the Committee includes the leadership of every student
club and organization.

#### Section 4. Meetings.

Meetings of the Committee include the Officers and the General Membership
of the Committee. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the Director of
Clubs and Organizations as necessary for the purpose of informing clubs and
organizations of funding procedures and issues of importance.

#### Section 5. Student Group Classifications.

Student Groups are categorized by the Director of Clubs and Organizations into
one of two classifications. A Student Group’s classification determines how a
Student Group is allocated money.

**Clubs.** By default, Student Groups are classified as Clubs. Clubs generally
have a smaller membership, are newer, and/or usually request less money from the
Committee. Clubs request money from the Committee as needed by sending a request
to the Director.

**Organizations.** A Student Group may petition to the Director to be
classified as an Organization. Organizations are student groups that have
demonstrated a need for significant or consistent funding. Notable indicators
for being a good candidate for Organization status include having at least 10
members, and existing for at least 1 year. Failed petitions to become an
Organization can be appealed to the Council of Olin Representatives, who decides
the status of the Group for the remainder of the school year. Organizations
request an annual budget from the Committee at the beginning of the school year.
Once a budget is allocated, an Organization may spend its money without further
approval from the Committee or its Officers. Organizations may request
additional funds as needed from the Committee. Maintaining Organization status
is contingent on an Organization keeping accurate financial records which can be
produced upon request. Organization status is granted for one year at a time.

#### Section 6. CCO Budget.

The CCO Budget is allocated jointly by the Director and Assistant Director of
Clubs and Organizations for the purpose of fulfilling the Mission and Function
of the Committee.

#### Section 7. Funding Procedure.

The Director of Clubs and Organizations defines the system for requesting club
funding every year. A description of this system is made available to the
Student Body. The following rules apply to club funding requests:

1. Every request must come in at least 72 hours before the event. Any online purchases
   require a 2-week requesting period. Requests not meeting
   these deadlines are not guaranteed a response in time for the event.
2. Funding should be requested and approved before the event is advertised if
   the event is contingent on funding.
3. Every request must be approved before the items are purchased. Anything
   purchased before the request is approved will not be reimbursed.
4. If a club does not properly fulfill the club funding request and
   reimbursement process once, they receive a short warning.
5. If a club does not properly fulfill the club funding request and
   reimbursement process twice, the Director of Clubs and Organizations may
   withhold club funding for 2 months.
6. If a club does not properly fulfill the club funding request and
   reimbursement process another time after the 2 month penalty, the Director
   of Clubs and Organizations may withhold club funding for the remainder of
   the year.
7. If a club fails to turn in a receipt within 7 days of the purchase the club
   will either be given a warning or a one month spending ban, at the
   discretion of the Vice President for Finance.
8. Failure to turn in two receipts in the course of one academic year may
   result in a spending ban for the remainder of the semester, at the
   discretion of the Vice President for Finance.

#### Section 8. Spending Limits and Rules.

In order to fairly distribute club funding, the following spending limits and
rules are established.

##### General Guidelines.
1. When a request is made, the requestor should include the expected turnout
   for the event. The Director of Clubs and Organizations may challenge the
   expected turnout and ask for some reasonable reassurance the number will be
   accurate.
2. For a one-time, on-campus event, the suggested limit is $5 per person.
3. For a one-time, off-campus event, the suggested limit is $10 per person.
4. For a recurring on-campus event, the suggested limit is $3 per person.
5. For a recurring off-campus event, the suggested limit is $5 per person.
6. These limits are not hard limits. If an event is unthrowable at this limit,
   the Director of Clubs and Organizations may approve the funding necessary to
   run the event.
7. If a club wants to purchase items for long term use (more than 1 semester),
   the club has a soft limit of $20 per club member. Usually this is seen as
   the majority of the club’s spending for the year.
8. The Committee can reimburse transportation costs in whole or in part
   (depending on cost) when there was no cheaper transportation option, up to
   but not exceeding the current suggested spending limits.

##### Food Related Rules.
1. Clubs may never purchase individual meals for club members.
2. Clubs may however purchase general meals for the club members.
3. Clubs have a hard limit of $3 per person to purchase food for events.
  * This limit does not affect clubs or events where food is the focus.
4. Questions and edge cases regarding food are handled at the discretion of the
   Director of Clubs and Organizations.

#### Section 9. Joint Events.

A club or organization may organize the event with another Student Government
Committee and receive funding from beyond the limits of Committee for Clubs and
Organizations funding. This spending must be approved by the Officers of both
Committees.

### Article 6. The Committee for Supporting, Encouraging, and Recognizing Volunteerism.

#### Section 1. Function.

Pursuant to its mission, as defined in the Constitution ([Article 8, Section
1](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_constitution.md#section-1-mission-3)),
the Committee for Supporting, Encouraging, and Recognizing Volunteerism oversees
the direction, continuity, and ongoing health of community service at the
College. The Committee allocates service related organization budgets annually
and allocates funds to service related clubs upon request. The Committee may
hold or coordinate events and activities related to service and volunteerism at
the College.

#### Section 2. Officers.

The Committee has two elected Officers, the Director and Assistant Director of
Service.

**Director of Service.** The Director of Service runs meetings of the Committee
and generally oversees the Committee’s activities. The Director acts as the
voice of the Committee and thereby markets and advertises on behalf of the
Committee. The Director attends meetings of the Student Government prepared to
report the activities and spending of the Committee. With the agreement of the
Assistant Director, the Director may appropriate money from the SERV Budget.

**Assistant Director of Service.** The Assistant Director of Service assists the
Director in the operations of the Committee. The Assistant Director keeps the
financial records, meeting minutes, service activity records, and membership
list of the Committee. In the absence of the Director, the Assistant Director
performs the duties of the Director and attends meetings of the Student
Government. With the agreement of the Director, the Assistant Director may
appropriate money from the SERV Budget.

#### Section 3. General Membership.

All students are “encouraged to contribute their time and wealth to support
philanthropic endeavors of their choice” by the Founding Precepts of Olin
College (Section 5). Therefore, there is an expectation that the entire Student
Body must maintain a spirit of volunteerism. More specifically, any student
interested in helping to organize school-wide service events and who attends
meetings of the Committee is considered part of the General Membership of the
Committee.

#### Section 4. Meetings.

The Committee meets weekly to coordinate and plan for upcoming events and
service opportunities and to reflect on the success of previous activities.
Meetings of the Committee include the Officers and the General Membership. The
Director and Assistant Director of Service also schedule regular meetings with
the Student Affairs adviser, faculty adviser, and staff adviser to keep them up
to date and find opportunities to involve the entire Olin community in
maintaining a spirit of service and volunteerism. Announcements of meetings
times and agendas are sent to the SERV mailing list prior to meetings.

#### Section 5. SERV Budget.

The SERV Budget is allocated jointly by the Director and Assistant Director of
Service for the purpose of fulfilling the Mission and Function of the Committee.

#### Section 6. Funding Procedures.

The Committee for Supporting, Encouraging, and Recognizing Volunteerism
allocates the SERV Budget as follows.

**School-wide Service Events.** The Director and Assistant Director of Service
and the General Membership of the Committee are able to make purchases for
school-wide service events within an agreed upon budget for each event decided
by the Director and Assistant Director of Service.

**Service Pursuits.** Through the Service Pursuits program, students may apply
for transportation and supply funding for a service activity. These projects
are reviewed and approved by the Director and the Assistant Director of Service.
Students may form groups in order to collectively receive more funding for a
project. We encourage larger groups of students to work together on service
projects to increase philanthropic spirit within the Community.

**Service Student Groups.** While General Student Groups are funded by the
Committee for Clubs and Organizations, Service Student Groups may be funded by
the Committee for Supporting, Encouraging, and Recognizing Volunteerism.

## Part III. Relative to the Procedures and Provisions.

### Article 9. The Student Activities Fund.

#### Section 1. Source of Funding.

The money in the Student Activities Fund comes from each student's’ payment of

Student Activities Fee rests with the Board of Trustees.

Documents are not being followed, the Honor Board requests that the
person(s) responsible resolve the issue within an appropriate amount of time
after which the person(s) responsible must send the Honor Board a report
outlining how and when the issue was resolved. The time allowed for the
completion of the report is up to the discretion of the Honor Board. If a
report is not filed outlining the resolution of the infraction within the given
timeframe, the Honor Board may file a case report about Student Government
citing the infraction, and an abstract is published to the community after
investigation and resolution through the Honor Board process.

### Article 11. Election Procedures.

The Class Representative positions are only open to students from the
particular class which the position represents.

#### Section 2. The Election Monitor.

At a meeting of the Student Government before the beginning of an election
process, the Student Government holds an internal election for the position of
Election Monitor. The duties and responsibilities of the position are as
follows:

**Election Monitor.** The Election Monitor facilitates all Student Government
elections occurring in a particular election season or special election. The
Election Monitor creates all necessary ballots and distributes candidate
information as outlined in the By-Laws. The Election Monitor enforces
campaigning rules and guidelines defined in the By-Laws. The Election Monitor
counts the ballots, and the results of the election are not final until the
Election Monitor validates them.

Any member of the Student Government who does not intend to run for office may
volunteer as a candidate for the position of Election Monitor. The Election
Monitor is ineligible to run for any Student Government position while serving
as Election Monitor. At the beginning of the meeting, the presiding officer
solicits candidates for the position. If there is only one candidate for
the position, the candidate in question takes the role of Election Monitor
without further debate or voting.

In the case of multiple candidates, each candidate gives a brief statement
and is asked by the President to leave the room. The remaining members of
the Student Government may deliberate and vote by excellence voting. The
candidate with the most votes becomes Election Monitor. In the case of no
candidates, the Dean of Student Life performs the duties of the Election
Monitor.

In the case of a Special Election, where calling a meeting of the Student
Government only to elect an Election Monitor would be inexpedient, the
presiding officer of the Council appoints an Election Monitor from the
membership of the Student Government.

#### Section 3. Regular Elections.

A Regular Election takes one week to complete. To stagger the large number of
positions being elected in the spring, the spring elections occur over two of
these week-long election cycles. The fall elections need only one cycle. At the
beginning of a week-long election, nominations are open for at least 48 hours
during which a real-time list of nominations accepted by the Election Monitor is
available to the Student Body. A presentation slide serves as a student’s
declaration of candidacy and is required in order to run for office. At the end
of the week, the polls are open for at least 24 hours. In between the close of
nominations and the opening of the polls, campaigning takes place. If there are
no candidates for a position or none of the candidates for a position garner at
least 50% of the vote, an election for the position is held again as part of the
next scheduled election or as part of a special election, if appropriate.

The following positions are elected in the first spring election cycle:

1. President
2. Vice President for Communications
3. Vice President for Finance
4. Director of Student Activities
5. Director of Clubs and Organizations
6. Director of Service
7. Chair of the Honor Board
8. Vice Chair of the Honor Board

The following positions are elected in the second spring election cycle:

1. Assistant Director of Student Activities
2. Assistant Director of Clubs and Organizations
3. Assistant Director of Service
4. Representative for Campus Services
5. Representative to Marketing and Communications, and Development, Family, and
   Alumni Relations
6. Representative to the Office of Student Affairs and Resources, and
   Admissions
7. Representative for Curriculum and Faculty
8. Representative for Intercollegiate Affairs
9. Senior Class Representative
10. Junior Class Representative
11. Sophomore Class Representative
12. Senior Class Activities Representative
13. Four Honor Board General Members

The following positions are elected in the only fall election cycle:

1. Two First Year Class Representatives
2. Two Honor Board General Members (at least one of whom must be a First Year)
3. Any positions not filled during the spring elections

Students elected to office during Spring Elections take office as soon as is
reasonable after April 1st as agreed upon by the incoming and outgoing
Presidents.

Students elected to office during Fall Elections take office immediately
upon election.

#### Section 4. Campaigning.

During an election, between the close of nominations and the beginning of
voting, candidates may campaign in a respectful and appropriate manner. The
Election Monitor investigates allegations of inappropriate campaigning and
decides upon what actions to take ranging from a warning to disqualification.

To preserve an intellectual atmosphere and guarantee equal opportunities of
election, campaigning outside of the following rules is prohibited, and
infractions to the following rules are addressed by the Election Monitor.
Candidates may not:

1. campaign in the Academic Center or Milas Hall except when authorized by the
   Election Monitor,
2. knock on doors or otherwise disturb students in the comfort of their own
   rooms,
3. post an excessive amount of campaign materials,
4. spend their own money to purchase campaign paraphernalia,
5. send emails to the Student Body regarding their campaign, or
6. disrespect other candidates.

Candidates are responsible for removing their campaign materials as soon as
possible after the election.

To organize campaigning, the Election Monitor email to the Student Body the
required presentation slides submitted by candidates. The Election Monitor may
also organize election-wide campaigning events at which all candidates may
participate.

#### Section 5. Voting.

At the end of an election, students vote on the positions up for election.
Members of the Student Government are elected by excellence voting - a student
may vote for as many of the candidates as they feel would excel in, and are
qualified for, the position. Votes are cast by secret ballot. The ballots are
prepared and distributed by the Election Monitor.

Seniors and other students not matriculating at Olin in the following academic
year may not vote in spring elections. Class Representative positions may only
be voted for by students in the particular graduating class which the position
represents. Students that consider themselves members of multiple graduating
classes may choose which Class Representative position they vote for, providing
they only vote for one Class Representative position.

For each position except for Honor Board General Members and Vice Chair of the
Honor Board, the winner is the student with the most excellence votes and
who has garnered at least 50% of the votes. That is to say the winner must be
considered qualified by at least 50% of voters.

For the position of Vice Chair of the Honor Board, the winner is the student who
is not in the same class as the newly elected chair who has the most excellence
votes and who has garnered at least 50% of the votes.

For Honor Board General Members, the winners are the students with the most
excellence votes and who have garnered at least 50% of the votes, given that at
the end of  Fall Elections, there is at least one student from each class on the
Honor Board.

If no candidate meets these conditions, the election for that position occurs in
the next scheduled election or as part of a special election, if appropriate.

#### Section 6. Impeachment.

Any student may initiate Student Government impeachment proceedings at any
time. Impeachable offenses include:

1. Major violations of the Honor Code
2. Abuse of power
3. Gross neglect of duty

To begin impeachment proceedings against a Student Government officer not on
the Honor Board, a student may submit a request for impeachment, including
specific charge(s), to the Chair of the Honor Board. The Chair of the Honor
Board convenes a meeting of the Student Government no more than five business
days from the day the request is submitted and notifies members of the
Student Government of the time and location of the meeting within one business
day of the receipt of the request.

All members of the Student Government not under investigation will be
considered the quorum for Student Government impeachment hearings. Impeachment
hearings are moderated by the Chair of the Honor Board.

The reporter and reported have the chance to present their argument and call
witnesses. Each are responsible for their respective witnesses.

At the end of the meeting, all members of the Student Government not currently
under investigation vote on the removal of the student(s) in question. A vote of
75% of the eligible membership is required to remove a student from office.

If a request for impeachment is submitted against an Honor Board member, the
impeachment proceedings proceed the same as above with following exceptions.

In the impeachment procedure for a member of the Honor Board, the Office of
Student Affairs and Resources replaces the Chair of the Honor Board as the party
responsible for calling a hearing. The Associate Dean of Student Life for
Programs moderates the hearing but does not have voting power.

All members of the Honor Board not under investigation are considered quorum for
the meeting and vote on the removal of the student(s) in question. The decision
of the Honor Board is subject to approval by the Dean of Student Life.

#### Section 7. Resignation.

A member of the Student Government not on the Honor Board may resign from office
by submitting a written letter of resignation to the President of the Student
Government or, in the case of a President's resignation, the Vice President for
Communications.

Honor Board members may resign from office by submitting a written letter of
resignation to the Chair of the Honor Board. The Chair of the Honor Board may
resign from office by submitting a written letter of resignation to the
Dean of Student Life.

#### Section 8. Vacancies.

A vacancy in the one of the three Executive positions of the Student Government
is filled by an internal election within the Council of Olin Representatives
where any Council member is eligible. The vote is done by excellence voting
while the candidates are out of the room.

A vacancy in the one of the three Committee Director positions of the Student
Government is filled by their respective assistant director.

A vacancy in the position of Chair of the Honor Board is temporarily filled by
the Vice Chair of the Honor Board. A vacancy in the position Vice Chair of the
Honor Board is temporarily filled by a current member of the Honor Board, to be
determined by an internal election run by the Chair. If the positions of both
Chair and Vice Chair become vacant simultaneously, the Honor Board must meet as
soon as possible to elect a temporary Chair and Vice Chair from its current
members. The temporary Chair and Vice Chair are responsible for the proceedings
of the Honor Board until a Special Election is held to fill those vacancies.
Upon close of the Special Election, all Honor Board members still in temporary
positions return to their originally elected positions and the newly elected
members will begin their term.

In the event that a Special Election of a new Chair or Vice Chair of the Honor
Board results in a graduating class not having a representative on the Honor
Board, a second Special Election is held electing another member to the Board.
This Special Election is open to candidates from the unrepresented class. If no
one runs, or no candidate receives 50% of the vote, then no one is elected and
the Honor Board's composition remains unchanged.

Any other vacancy is filled by a Special Election.

#### Section 9. Special Elections.

Special Elections are held using the same week-long format as Regular Elections
except they only occur as necessary and students elected to a position through a
Special Election take office immediately upon election.

#### Section 10. Transition.

In order to maintain institutional memory, each elected member of the Student
Government keeps a transition document which they continually update during
their time in office. Each official’s transition document is kept in a central
location which can be accessed by the current members of the Student Government.
Each elected official must meet with their successor to discuss their respective
transition document upon leaving office.

### Article 12. Amendment Procedures.

#### Section 1. Amending the Constitution.

Any member of the Student Body may propose an amendment to the Student
Government Constitution by presenting the amendment in written form to the
President of the Student Government. The Student Government reviews the
amendment at its next meeting and decides whether to call a Town Meeting.

If the amendment passes review, the President calls a Town Meeting within three
school weeks. The Vice President for Communications sends an announcement
containing the finalized amendment to the entire Student Body at least one week
in advance of the Town Meeting. The Student Body decides at a Town Meeting
whether or not to approve the amendment. The Vice President for Communications
sends an announcement describing the outcome of the meeting to the entire
Student Body within 24 hours of the close of the meeting.

#### Section 2. Amending the By-Laws.

Any member of the Student Body may propose an amendment to the By-Laws by
presenting the amendment in written form to the President of the Student
Government at least one week in advance of the meeting of the Student
Government at which the author would like the amendment to be addressed.

The Vice President for Communications sends an announcement to the Student
Body about the amendment at least three days in advance of the next Student
Government meeting to allow for a three day reading period. During the meeting
at which the amendment is addressed, the Student Government hears testimony from
every student who wishes to speak and engages in open discussion about the
amendment. The amendment may be amended by a simple majority of the Student
Government during the meeting.

When discussion has concluded, the President calls for a vote on the amendment.
Per the Student Government Constitution, approval of 75% of the voting members
of the Student Government is required to pass the amendment. The Vice President
for Communications sends an announcement detailing any changes to the By-Laws
and describing the outcome of the meeting to the entire Student Body within 24
hours of the close of the meeting.

#### Section 3. Referendum.

If working through the Student Government yields no result, any member of the
Student Body may propose an amendment to either the Constitution or the By-Laws
and bypass approval of the Student Government by presenting to the President of
the Student Government the amendment in written form accompanied by the
supporting signatures of at least 10% of the Student Body.

The President must call a Town Meeting within three school weeks. The Vice
President for Communications sends an announcement containing the finalized
amendment to the entire Student Body at least one week in advance of the Town
Meeting. The Student Body decides at the Town Meeting whether or not to approve
the amendment.

#### Section 4. Town Meetings.

The President of the Student Government may call a Town Meeting to hold a
community discussion, to update the Student Body on the activities of the
Student Government or the Administration, to vote on an amendment to the
Constitution, or, in the case of Referendum, to vote on an amendment to the
By-Laws.

Town Meetings where a vote is held to amend a Governing Document require quorum
of one half of the Student Body. Amendments may not be changed during Town
Meetings with the exception that typos may be corrected. An open discussion and
a question and answer session must precede a vote to amend a Governing Document.

At the close of the Town Meeting, all present students vote by secret ballot,
once per amendment with the option to either accept or reject the amendment. If
quorum is reached and an amendment receives more than 50% of the votes of those
present, the amendment passes and the Governing Document is changed accordingly.
Otherwise, the Governing Document remains unchanged. The Vice President for
Communications sends an announcement describing the outcome of the meeting to
the entire Student Body within 24 hours of the close of the meeting.

### Article 13. Transparency.

#### Section 1. Purpose.

To make the Student Government well-organized and accessible to the Student
Body, the Student Government and its Committees strive to effectively
communicate with the Student Body through use of email, school-administered
file shares, and physical documents.

#### Section 2. Transparency Documents.

The Student Government maintains a number of running documents describing the
actions of the Student Government for the duration of its existence. The purpose
of these documents is to gather information about the Student Government in an
easily-read way. These Transparency Documents are continuously updated by the
members of the Student Government, and are as follows:

**The List of Official Actions.** This document contains a record of every
Official Action of the Student Government and the Council of Olin
Representatives, which are described in [Article 1, Section
4](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-4-official-actions)
and [Article 2, Section 8](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-8-official-actions)
respectively. The list is in reverse-chronological order (with the most recent
Official Action at the top), and contains the full text of every Official
Action, as well as a brief summary of the action if necessary.

contains the names, descriptions, and officers or appointees of all recognized
and unrecognized student clubs and organizations, branches of the student
government, Council Projects, project teams, and Faculty and Operational
Committees established by the Administration of the College.

**The Report on the Student Activities Fund.** As described in [Article 2,
Section 2](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/blob/master/student_government_bylaws.md#section-2-executives),

order (with the most recent report at the top).

**The Meeting Minutes.** Each meeting of the Student Government and its
Committees, including Town Meetings, have minutes detailing the topics discussed
in the meeting and actions that were taken. Copies of these minutes are kept in
a central location Meetings which the presiding officer of the meeting deem
private and inappropriate for general knowledge, such as Honor Board hearings,
are exempted.

**The Governing Documents History.** All past versions of the Governing
Documents are kept in a central location. Minor changes, such as changes to
grammar, spelling, references, or names of people, digital, or physical
locations, are not required to have a unique version.

Additionally, each Transparency Document contains the name of a current
member of the Student Government, specifically identified as the contact for
questions or comments regarding the Transparency Document.

#### Section 3. Call to Action.

An annual Call to Action is sent to the Student Body in the first two weeks of
classes each school year. This Call to Action informs the Student Body of the
core-discussion mailing list, of the locations of the Transparency Documents, of
the elected members of the Student Government, and of the planned open meeting
times of the Student Government and its Committees.
