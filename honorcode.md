# Olin College Honor Code
## 1. PURPOSE OF THE HONOR CODE
This Honor Code, written and maintained by the students of Olin College, exists
to provide an ethical framework for the Olin student community. It represents
an individual commitment by each Olin student to dedicate themselves to these
standards, as well as a community commitment to ensure that these standards are
upheld. This Code will serve always as a bold statement that ethics are not
optional at Olin and that they are simultaneously an individual and community
concern.
## 2. COLLEGE JURISDICTION
Olin College students are members of the college community as well as citizens
of the Town of Needham and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. As citizens,
students are responsible to the community of which they are a part and the
college neither substitutes for nor interferes with the regular legal
processes. Students are also accountable for offenses against the academic
community. Therefore, an action involving a student in a legal proceeding in a
civil or criminal court does not free the student from responsibility for their
conduct in a college proceeding. If a student is charged in both jurisdictions,
the college will proceed with its internal review according to its own
timetable. Also see Appendix B for articulation with Babson College, Wellesley
College, and Brandeis University student judicial systems.
## 3. HONOR CODE VALUES
### 3.1 Integrity
I will represent myself accurately and completely in my work, my words, and my
actions in academic and in non-academic affairs.
### 3.2 Respect for Others

considerate of their inherent dignity, identity, and personal property. I will
not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, age, marital
or parental status, veteran status, sex, disability, genetic information,
sexual orientation, and/or gender identity. I will also care for community
resources and facilities so others may effectively use them.
### 3.3 Passion for the Welfare of Olin College
I will be a steward for the welfare of Olin College through a spirit of
cooperation, concern for others, and responsibility for the reputation of Olin
College.
### 3.4 Openness to Change
I will be receptive to change, supportive of innovation, and willing to take
risks for the benefit of the community.
### 3.5 Do Something
I will strive to better myself and my community and take responsibility for my
own behavior. When I become aware of a violation of the Honor Code or an issue
within the community, I will take action towards resolution of the situation. I
expect others to do the same.

### 4.2 Reporting and Hearing Procedures
#### Reporting Overview
There are several tracks that students or community members have when
considering using the college as a means of adjudicating a violation of the
Honor Code or related College policies. This Honor Code outlines the track that
involves the Olin College Honor Board, a group of elected student
representatives and appointed employees of the college responsible for
facilitating adjudication of violation reports sent to them. Other tracks -
direct facilitation and/or adjudication by the Office of Student Affairs,
direct facilitation and/or adjudication by the Olin College Title IX
Coordinator, civil or criminal courts, etc. are not bound to the same process
as outlined herein.
#### Report
In order to submit a report to the Honor Board for review, any Olin community
member  can file a report form that is received by the Chair, Vice Chair, or
Adviser to the Honor Board. The details of the layout and content of the
report form are subject to the determination of the current Honor Board. At
minimum, the Report cites a violation of at least one of either the Honor Code
Values or college policies or procedures. The Honor Board Leadership and
Facilitation Team have the responsibility to view each report that is filed and
make a decision of whether or not to proceed with the Case. The Chair and Vice
Chair have the ability to dismiss a report if it is not under the jurisdiction
of the Honor Code. If they do not dismiss it, normal procedures are followed.
#### Determining Merit
Upon receiving a report, the Honor Board Leadership will assign a Facilitation
Team to it. If either the Honor Board Leadership or the Facilitation Team feels
they are not able to clearly determine merit from the content of the report,
the Facilitation team should conduct an Investigative Procedure. The purpose
of this procedure is not to determine responsibility, but merely whether or not
a Report is worthy. In absence of obvious lack of merit after an Investigative
Procedure, all Reports should be assumed to have merit and be continued to a
Case.
#### Investigative Procedure
If an Investigative Procedure is deemed necessary by either the Honor Board
Leadership or the Facilitation Team, the Facilitation Team shall interview the
Reported and the Reporter about the alleged violation and shall gather from
both parties names of witnesses able to substantially contribute to the
Facilitation Team’s understanding of the alleged violation. Members of the
Facilitation Team may interview witnesses with substantive knowledge of the
alleged violation. It is critical that the Facilitation Team conduct this
process in a timely manner. In absence of obvious lack of merit after an
efficient Investigative Procedure, all Reports should be assumed to have merit
and be continued to a Case. If, in a Case that does not involve a potential
academic violation of the Honor Code, all members of the Facilitation Team,
as well as all Reporters, Reported, and involved Aggrieved Parties, agree that
an alternate solution may resolve the issue presented by a report without
requiring a hearing, then the Facilitation Team may recommend that the solution
be attempted. The outcome of this attempt will then be taken into consideration
when the Facilitation Team determines whether or not to refer the Case to the
Honor Board.
#### Hearing
During each Hearing one member of the Facilitation Team shall serve as
moderator and the other shall serve as recorder. Neither the moderator nor the
recorder shall have decision-making power. The Hearing Panel is formed as
defined in Section 4.1. The faculty and/or staff representatives to the Honor
Board may be present at hearings, though their presence is not required and
they hold no decision-making power. If the Honor Board is unable to meet its
obligations in a timely fashion due to scheduling conflicts, disqualifications,
or other reasons that the Dean of Student Affairs determines may compromise its
effectiveness, the Dean may appoint an ad hoc Facilitation Team.

Upon formation of the Hearing Panel the Facilitation Team will deliver the
charges to the Reported and the Reported will be given the opportunity to
accept or not accept Responsibility. If Responsibility is accepted, the Case
will then proceed to a Sanction Setting Hearing. If Responsibility is not
accepted the Case will proceed to a Responsibility Hearing. Absent 
extraordinary circumstances, a Hearing shall be held within sixty business days
of a Report being submitted and ten business days from the date the
Facilitation Team delivers the charges to the Reported. All Hearings will be
closed to all persons other than the Facilitation Team, the Hearing Panel, the
Adviser to the Honor Board, Witnesses, Aggrieved Parties, the Reporter, the
Reported, and their Advisers. Notice of the Hearing shall be delivered to the
Aggrieved Parties, the Reporter, the Reported, and Witnesses either in person,
or to the appropriate campus mailboxes, or to the appropriate e-mail accounts,
at least two business days in advance of the hearing. Notice to the Reported
shall include the charge(s) against the Reported.

#### Responsibility Hearing
Immediately prior to the Hearing, the Hearing Panel will receive the Report
submitted by the Reported and will be briefed by the Facilitation Team. During
the Hearing the Reported and the Reporter will both be given the opportunity to
speak, if present, and the Hearing Panel will have the opportunity to ask
questions of each. Decisions shall be based solely upon evidence and testimony
introduced at the Hearing and the briefing provided by the Facilitation Team.

The Hearing Panel shall make one of the following decisions: (a) a finding of
not responsible, (b) a finding of responsible (based on preponderance of the
evidence), to be followed up by a Sanction Setting Hearing, or (c) continuance
of the Case to obtain additional information or for further consideration. All
decisions shall be made by consensus.

#### Sanction Setting Hearing
Prior to the recommendation of Sanction(s), the Reported may present one
Character Witness. Advisers may serve as the Character Witness during a
Sanction Setting Hearing.

The Hearing Panel may request and/or review recommendations for Sanction(s)
from the Reported, the Aggrieved Parties, and the Reporter. The Reported may
respond to the Hearing Panel’s recommended Sanction(s) prior to the close of
the Hearing. The Dean of Student Affairs shall review sanctions recommended by
the Hearing Panel. Decisions shall be based solely upon evidence and testimony
introduced at the Hearing(s) and shall be made by consensus (i.e., unanimous
vote of the voting members of the Hearing Panel who do not abstain from 
voting). The Hearing Panel shall include in the materials it submits to the
Dean of Student Affairs a brief written summary of the Reported’s response,
if given.

#### Appeals
Upon conclusion of an Honor Board hearing and delivery of the outcome to the
parties involved, the Reported and/or Reporter may appeal a “finding of responsibility” or
“sanctions” by writing via email to the Dean of Student Affairs within one
business day following the delivery of the outcome of the hearing. The Appeal
letter must clearly state the grounds and rationale for the Appeal. Once
received, the Dean of Student Affairs will convene an Appeals Board. The
members of the Appeals Board will be the Faculty Representative to the Honor
Board, the Staff Representative to the Honor Board, and a student member of the
Honor Board determined by the Honor Board Leadership. None of the Appeals
Board members will have been involved in the adjudication of the Case being
appealed. The Dean may appoint new members to the panel in the event of a
conflict or add members as needed. In the latter case, this may result in more
than three voting members on the Appeals Board.

The purpose of the Appeals Board is to review all information available
pertaining to hearings and proceedings that led to the Appeal to ensure that
these were conducted according to the established judicial procedures. The
Appeals Board will not substitute its own judgment for a “finding of
responsibility” or “sanctions”. Requests for appeal may be made to the Dean
of Student Affairs on the following grounds:
1. Procedural error;
2. New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the Hearing
that could change the outcome of the Hearing;
3. Belief that the severity of the Sanction is inappropriate given the details
of the Case.

Disagreement with the finding(s) or Sanction(s) is not, by itself, grounds for
Appeal.

The Appeals Board may rule in one of three ways:
1. They may recommend a new Hearing before a new Hearing Panel.
2. They may recommend the Case go back to the original Hearing Panel for
further review for reasons such as new evidence that was not available during
the original Hearing.
3. They may recommend that the Appeal be denied.

If the Appeal is denied, the Sanction(s) will be imposed and the college will
consider the Case closed. The Appeals Board must inform the Dean of Student
Affairs about the outcome of the Appeal deliberations within 10 business days
of the written Appeal being received. The Dean of Student Affairs will notify,
in writing, the Reporter, the Reported, and Aggrieved Parties of the outcome of
the Appeal within 2 business days of receiving the outcome from the Appeals
Board.

Barring any extraordinary circumstances, if a request for Appeal is filed,
Sanction(s) resulting from the Case will typically be put on hiatus and not
implemented until after the Appeal is resolved. If an emergency suspension or
dismissal has been administered, the student must leave campus and remain off
campus during the Appeal process.

#### Failure to Comply with Sanction(s)
If the student fails to comply with sanctions, the Honor Board Chair and Vice
Chair will determine if a noncompliance hearing (which is handled by the Dean
of Student Affairs) is needed or if the Dean of Student Affairs is granted
authority to setup a separate process.

#### Streamlined Academic Report
In the event that a faculty or staff member identifies a violation of academic
integrity, the faculty or staff member and the Reported will work independently
to develop an appropriate Sanction. A summary of the violation and resolution
is submitted to the Honor Board Leadership for reviewing and recording.

## 5. AMENDMENTS
Within a month of the start of every academic year, a town hall must be called
to ratify and/or amend the Honor Code for that academic year.

Any member of the Olin student body may submit a proposal for an amendment to
the Honor Code to the Honor Board Chair or Vice Chair. The proposal must
include the reasons for the amendment and the proposed wording of the
amendment, along with signatures of at least 10% of the student body.

Once the proposal has been brought to the Honor Board, a Town Hall Meeting must
be called within the semester to discuss and vote on the proposed amendment.
Multiple amendments may be considered at one Town Hall Meeting. The Town Hall
Meeting is open to all of the Olin community, and all students are expected to
make an effort to attend. Quorum (half of the student body) must be met to vote
on any amendments.

At the close of the meeting, all present students will vote by secret ballot,
once per amendment, with the option to vote for each proposed amendment or the
unchanged Honor Code. If no choice receives the votes of more than 50% of the
student body or 75% of the students voting at the meeting, whichever is
smaller, or if quorum is not reached, the Code remains unchanged.

After all proposed amendments are voted upon, all present students will vote by
secret ballot on whether or not to abolish the Honor Code. If neither choice
receives the vote of more than 50% of the student body the Honor Code remains
in effect.

If the Honor Code is abolished, policies drafted by the Student Affairs Office
will take effect immediately. In order to reinstate the Honor Code, a proposal
must be submitted to the Student Affairs Office, which will put the issue to a
student vote, as per the policies of the Student Affairs Office.

## 6. ARTICULATION WITH BABSON COLLEGE, WELLESLEY COLLEGE AND BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY STUDENT JUDICIAL SYSTEMS
Olin College has agreed with Babson College and Brandeis University to enforce
their respective conduct standards when their students participate in academic,
Co-Curricular and extracurricular pursuits on the neighboring (host) campuses.
The Olin College honor system will hear cases in which Olin students are
reported of violating a host campus’s standards, using the host’s policies and
definitions but Olin disciplinary procedures. Similarly, the Babson and
Brandeis judicial systems will hear cases in which their students are reported
of violating Olin standards, using Olin policies and definitions but their own
judicial procedures.

When on each other’s campuses, Olin and Wellesley students will be subject to
the host campus’ standards of conduct for academic integrity. The host campus’
disciplinary process will be used when an Olin or Wellesley student violates
the host’s standards. The Student Affairs Office at Olin will work closely with
the Dean of Students at Wellesley to determine the best procedures to follow
for non-academic issues.

Olin students taking classes or participating in activities on other campuses
should familiarize themselves with the host’s student disciplinary system and
standards of conduct.
