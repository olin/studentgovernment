To ensure that the Student Government Constitution and Bylaws are followed, Student Government will periodically meet with one or more representatives of the Honor Board to review the actions of Student Government.

At each Review, should the Honor Board find that a portion of the governing documents are not being followed, the Honor Board will request that the person(s) responsible resolve the issue within an appropriate amount of time after which the person(s) responsible must send the Honor Board a report outlining how and when the issue was resolved. The time allowed for the report is up to the discretion of the Honor Board.

General Election Procedures are governed by the Student Government Bylaws.

To preserve an intellectual atmosphere and guarantee equal opportunities of election, campaigning is only allowed at the College within published guidelines specified in the Student Government Bylaws. The Election Monitor presiding over the election, and as needed, the Honor Board, will jointly investigate allegations of inappropriate campaigning and decide upon potential resolutions - up to and including removal from the ballot.

Voting for all positions will occur by ranked-choice voting and by secret ballot.
