# Olin College Student Government Constitution

*Agreed upon by the Students of Olin College, in Town Hall Meeting, on February
12, 2020. This Constitution will sunset on March 1, 2022.*

## Preamble

*We, the students of Olin College of Engineering, establish this Constitution
to empower the Student Government to actively represent the interests and
fulfill the changing needs of the Student Body.*

## Part I. The Student Government.

### Article 1. The Nature of Student Government.

#### Section 1. The Relationship.

The elected Student Leadership - Executives, Representatives, and Committee
Leaders - together form the Student Government which will have sole authority
to allocate the Student Activities Fund and amend the Student Government
Bylaws. This group will also have several functions, as described in [Article 2](#article-2-the-student-government).
A smaller subsection of the Student Government - the Executives and the
Representatives - will comprise the Council of Olin Representatives which alone
may not allocate the Student Activities Fund or amend the Student Government
Bylaws. However, this group may make recommendations to the College
Administration and Board of Trustees on behalf of the Student Government, and
will work to compile Action Items and prioritize their execution, as described
in [Article 3](#article-3-the-council-of-olin-representatives).

Structuring the Council as a subsection of Student Government enables the
Council to continually represent the Student Body and frees the Committee
Leaders to execute their missions while still involving the entire Student
Leadership in decisions that impact the entire school.

### Article 2. The Student Government.

#### Section 1. Name.

The combined legislative and executive organization of the Student Body will be
known as the Student Government.

#### Section 2. Mission.

The Student Government will facilitate and ensure communication between the
Administration of the College, the Council of Olin Representatives, the Student
Government Committees, and the Student Body. The Student Government will
allocate and oversee the Student Activities Fund and coordinate initiatives
requiring the involvement of both the Council of Olin Representatives and the
Student Government Committees. The Student Government will establish and
develop initiatives which improve the lives of students at Olin College.

#### Section 3. Structure.

The Student Government will consist of the elected members of the Council of
Olin Representatives and the Leaders of the Student Government Committees. In
the event of the absence of a Leader of a Student Government Committee, the
Assistant Leader of the Student Government Committee may stand in for the
Committee Leader and may carry the full voting power of the absent Leader.

#### Section 4. Source of Authority.

The Student Government derives its power from the consent of the Students and
the trust of the Administration and Board of Trustees of the College.

#### Section 5. Student Activities Fee.

The Board of Trustees of the College has ultimate authority over the Student
Activities Fee, which each student pays annually. The Student Government may
recommend changes to the Student Activities Fee to the Board of Trustees.

#### Section 6. Student Activities Fund.

The Student Activities Fund is funded through the Student Activities Fee. The
Student Government has ultimate authority over the allocation of the Student
Activities Fund. The Student Government has the power to divide the Student
Activities Fund into virtual funds to be used by the Council of Olin
Representatives, by Student Government Committees, and for other purposes
defined in the Student Government Bylaws.

#### Section 7. Amending the Bylaws.

The Student Government may amend the Student Government Bylaws using the
procedure described in [Article 12](#article-12-amendment-procedures).

or appointed non-voting ad hoc representatives of the Council.

### Article 3. The Council of Olin Representatives.

The core of the Student Government consisting of the Executives and the
Representatives will be known as the Council of Olin Representatives.

#### Section 2. Mission.

initiatives. The Council will represent Olin’s student body to the
administration, other colleges, and the outside world, while working to improve
student life by supporting and developing solutions to issues facing the
student body.

#### Section 3. Structure.

The Council will be comprised of three Executive Officers and some number of
elected Representatives, as defined in the Student Government Bylaws. The

Communications, and the Vice President for Finance. Between Executives and
Representatives, there must be at least one member of each graduating class.

#### Section 4. Allocation Powers.

The Council may allocate money from any fund allocated to the Council by the
Student Government.

#### Section 5. Recommendations.

The Council may express the official opinion of the Student Government by
making recommendations to the Administration and Board of Trustees of the
College.

#### Section 6. Action Items.

The Council may demonstrate the commitment of the Student Government to an
issue facing the Student Body by assigning tasks to its members for the purpose
of resolving the issue.

#### Section 7. Committee Appointments.

If a committee or working group of faculty and/or staff requests student
representative(s), the Council may solicit volunteers from the Student Body to
fill the representative positions on that committee. If there are more
volunteers than available positions, the Council will appoint students by
a procedure codified in the Student Government Bylaws.

#### Section 8. Appellate Authority.

As the representatives of the Student Body, the Council will arbitrate any
major disagreements between a Committee Leader and their Assistant Leader as
well as any major disagreements between a Committee and a club or organization
being funded by a Committee. In case of disagreement, the Council has ultimate
authority over money from virtual funds involved in the disagreement over which
