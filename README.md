# Olin College Student Government Repository

Originally established after the COReDesign of 2010, the 2015-2016 Council of
Olin Representatives (CORe) re-established this GitHub repository in order to
keep track of Student Government Governing Documents and their amendments over
time.

The documents here on the `master` branch represent what is currently being used
by student government. PDF editions and previous versions can be viewed at
the [releases](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/releases) section of
the repo.

List of previous significant versions:
- [v2.0.0](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/releases/tag/v2.0.0):
  governing documents after the 2015 Restructuring
- [v1.0.1](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment/releases/tag/v1.0.1): the
  initial version uploaded to the repo circa 2013

Amendments to the Constitution and Bylaws are listed below and can also be
